Revenge of the SIT
------------------

A rewrite of the original Simple Issue Tracker. The issue tracker works
with a text file that can be stored in version control. Text utilities
must work on this textfile (diff/merge, etc) to allow the VCS (version
control system) to manage the issues.



File format
-----------

The issues database is stored in a plain text file. No header exists for
this file. The file consists of a list of records. Each records consists
of a list of fields. All fields are plain ascii text only, with the bytes
0x00 and 0x08 reserved for use by the program.

Records are delimited by the character sequence "f\b\n". Fields are
delimited by the character sequence "f\b".
