## Revenge of the Simple Issue Tracker

### What is this?
This project, **RotSIT** (AKA Revenge of the Simple Issue Tracker) is a
simple issue tracker for software projects. If you are looking for a proper
issue tracker, this isn't it. Actually, even if you really wanted an
improper issue tracker this also wouldn't be it (If you find and improper
issue tracker please let me know - I'd love to see what it looks like).

This is a simple issue tracker that uses a plain-text database to store
issues in a manner that a source control system such as Git or SVN can track.

### What can RotSIT do?
Issues can be opened, closed, reopened and commented upon. A rudimentary
tool is built into the software that can filter issues according to
certain criteria (date, username, etc).

However since this is a plain-text database with selected and judicious
usage of newlines in the field separators you can use any text processing
tool to search through the database.
