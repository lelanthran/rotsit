To build this software you need to get the extended C library from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/libxc/

You do not need the sources for libxc, the binary download for your
platform will work just fine.

Install the libraries into $HOME/lib, with the headers in $HOME/include.

Then run make in this directory, or mingw32-make if you are on Windows.

If you are unable to build this software please wait a little while;
within the next few days I will put up prebuilt binaries for download.
